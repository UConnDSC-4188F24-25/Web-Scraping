# Hey All!

For this week, we will be undertaking a web scraping assignment where you will scrape company stock data. While this assignment may seem challenging, please keep the following in mind:

You are always free to explain your approach to the question to receive full credit (refer to the syllabus for more details).
At the beginning of the assignment, there is a link to a cheatsheet that you're welcome to use.

Message on Discord if you have any questions!

Best, Emmy
